As we all know, the internet is vast. So, I'll be defining each of these:

## Tiv's Definitions:
I'm really not too strict about these definitions. If you're unsure, just ask about it in the PR!
Or, if you think you've got a better definition than me for these terms (you probably do), open an issue or submit a PR! 

### Papers

Papers are scholarly written works. They can be papers about original research, literature reviews, metanalyses... etc. Papers, however, are not articles.
Usually, you'll find these in scholarly journals as opposed to, maybe, the New York Times.

This belongs in the "Papers" file

### Books
Usually, books are pretty long and cover a topic extensively. Some other good indicators include...
- An ISBN NUmber
- Publisher
- Section discussing legality
A powerpoint isn't a book.

This belongs in the "Books" file 

### Video
A video is a something that can be played and watched. Links are preferred.
