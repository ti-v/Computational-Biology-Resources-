# So You Want to Contribute...

YAY!!! Here are a few ways you can contribute:
- Adding a paper
- Adding a book
- Adding a video
- Adding a blog
- Adding a course
- Adding an article
- Adding powerpoints 
**Alternatively...**
- Suggesting things to widen scope
- Improving documentation
  
As we all know, the internet is vast. So, I'll be defining each of these:

## Tiv's Definitions:
I'm really not too strict about these definitions. If you're unsure, just ask about it in the PR!
Or, if you think you've got a better definition than me for these terms (you probably do), open an issue or submit a PR! 

### Papers

Papers are scholarly written works. They can be papers about original research, literature reviews, metanalyses... etc. Papers, however, are not articles.
Usually, you'll find these in scholarly journals as opposed to, maybe, the New York Times.

This belongs in the "Papers" file. 

### Books
Usually, books are pretty long and cover a topic extensively. Some other good indicators include...
- An ISBN NUmber
- Publisher
- Section discussing legality
A powerpoint isn't a book.

This belongs in the "Books" file 

### Video
A video is a something that can be played and watched. Links are preferred.

### Articles
Articles are geared more towards the general public and use more approachable language. You'll find these on websites such as the Harvard Gazette, newspapers, etc.

### Powerpoints
Powerpoints can be any kind of individual slideshow.

### Blog
Blogs are casual written posts from an individual. While the blogger doesn't have to just post about computational biology, it would be great if you could link posts specifically about comp. bio as opposed to the entire blogger if that's the case.

That being said, links to bloggers and blog posts are appreciated! 

### Course 
Courses usually involve some combination of notes, slideshows, videos, and problem sets to teach material. A single powerpoint or video does not count as a course. Please put them in their specified sections above! For the purposes of this repo, a video series counts as a course.

That should be it!

## Widening Scope and Improving Documentation

This repo isn't perfect. If you want to suggest a new way to sort, define, or word something, by all means go ahead!
Also, if you want to make a little sub-project for this (website, infographics, etc.), DO THAT TOO!! This is a little baby repo, so I appreciate any and all contiributions. Go crazy!!!!!!

If you want to suggest a big overhaul (like, reorganizing most things rather than adding a new section), please open an issue rather than a PR! It'll save you a lot of work, 
plus we can work on it together :)

Everything minor (adding new sections, adding a doc, fixing typos) can be in a PR.

## Notation
Here's how to format your contribution

(Cool Resource)[coolresourcelink] - Author (Platform) (PDF) (Tag 1) (Tag 2)

Here are some tags I would like you to use:

Is the source a PDF? - (PDF)
Does the source involve you downloading things to your computer? - (Download)
Is the source still being actively made? (WIP)
Does the source need you to provide information, such as email? (Information Needed)
Does the source need you to make an account (Registration Needed)
* Make sure the account isn't a SUBSCRIPTION! Your PR WILL be rejected if it needs you to fork over money. That kind of defeats the point of this repo.

## Free! Free! Free Stuff!

Your resources MUST be free to access. No money should be required. 
They should be LEGALLY free, too. It's okay if it's got a "all rights reserved," but free to read. But if you're screenshotting a book you had to pay for...yikes.
Don't pirate! We love Creative Commons! Also the MIT license! Very cool very nice.

## So, What Even IS a PR?

Pull (or merge) requests means that someone is proposing changes to an open-source project. Those proposed contributions are than reviewed by a maintainer and, if approved, added to the project! 

Now, I'm not sure how to do this via Git (hey, free PR people), but I do know how to do this via the website "GitHub"

1) Fork the PR
2) Make your OWN BRANCH, please
3) Make you changes by opening one of the files and doing whatever
4) Commit your changes
5) Make a pull request via the pull request tab

I'll probably included screenshots or something like that later. Depends. Most contributions you'll make to this project probably won't require you to use Git or download anything.

**Happy Contributing!**
