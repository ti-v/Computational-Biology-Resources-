# Computational-Biology-Resources-
Hi! This is a place to store FREE computational biology resources including textbooks, videos, papers, really ANYTHING! (That's legal). 
Transparently, I'm really just an enthusiast. I don't do this for a living, nor do I even know much about it. I want to give aspiring computational biologists
a free and accessibel way to start, and apsiring GitHub users a place to make their first pull request :)
That being said, although this is a place just for computational biology resources, ANYONE can contribute! As long as the resources are good, I don't care.

This repo was inspired by free programming books, which is also a repo hosted on GitHub, and the place where I made my first PRs.

**About Hacktoberfest:** I'll try to get this repo on Hacktoberfest, but I doubt they'd accept this repo. If they do, great! I'd love to get people who can actually code (unlike me) 
to hopefully make a coded website for this one day :) (Either that, or maybe I learn how to code...)
